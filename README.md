# ContosoUniversity III

### Summary
This application expands upon the ubiquitous ContosoUniversity sample application distributed by Mircrosoft demonstrating the use of Entity Framework 6 in ASP.Net MVC.  This is the third of several posts that will explore different architectural approaches to building the same application.  

ContosoUniversity III builds upon the original sample application introducing Web API, Data Transfer Objects (DTO's), Automapper and a self-hosted service layer using the Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN).
